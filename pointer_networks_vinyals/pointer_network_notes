implementations:
1. https://github.com/jojonki/Pointer-Networks â†’ sequence problems

Pros:
1. Pointer networks allows the model to effectively point to a specific position in the input sequence rather
than predicting an index value from a fixed size vocabulary. This makes it posibble to generalize beyond the pre-specified
graph size

Cons:
1. needs a supervised label set (we get it from a heuristic algorithm)
